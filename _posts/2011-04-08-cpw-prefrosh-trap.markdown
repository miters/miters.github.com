Oh hai prefrosh,
On behalf of MITERS, you are cordially invited to our build party TONIGHT (Friday April 8th) @ 7pm until past midnight. We're located @ the back of the MIT museum, close to Random. There will be free food (pizza) and cool things. If you like to build things for fun, come check us out!
