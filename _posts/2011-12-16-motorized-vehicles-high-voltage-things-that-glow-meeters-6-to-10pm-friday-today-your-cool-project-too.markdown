** impromptu talks may happen after 10 pm, if lots of people are interested
in something (how to etch circuits? how to use arduinos?).

Debates about the relationship between makerspaces and startups, open
source hardware / software business models and case studies, internet noise
and the optimal level of documentation, will happen if I'm still alive.
