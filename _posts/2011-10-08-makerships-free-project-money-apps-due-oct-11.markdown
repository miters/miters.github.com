Update-- now we're awarding** $750 in total!** Thanks to **techfair** -- techfair.mit.edu :)

MITERS wants to give you money ("makerships") to work on your own projects.
Apply here by Tuesday the 11th (it's a short and sweet form):
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDViZV9TVng0dFRWQ3pMVzI0aDVOdUE6MQ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDViZV9TVng0dFRWQ3pMVzI0aDVOdUE6MQ)

The details follow...

Makerships:
We want to give you money for your projects. We're allocating $500 a
semester toward grants for student (undergraduates only for now)
projects. (So requesting up to $100 or $200 is within reason, although
smaller requests are more likely to be granted).

MITERS:
MIT Electronics Research Society ([http://miters.mit.edu](../))
Originally founded as a club to give MIT students free and open access
to computers, MITERS now features a mill, lathe, band saws, welders*,
and other hands-on tools, in addition to a host of oscilloscopes,
high-end soldering irons, and other EE prototyping tools. Itâ€™s a
member-run creative haven and build-anything-you-want,
if-you-break-it,-fix-it space.
*currently out of operation, we're working on fixing

Key Dates:
* Oct 11 -- Last day of Columbus weekend -- application deadline
* Oct 14 -- Winners notified
* Dec 16 -- (tentative) MEETERS (MITERS End of Every Term Research Showcase)

Terms:
* Undergraduate (any school, as long as you come hang out at MITERS)
* Work on the project at MITERS as much as possible
* Present at MEETERS (probably Dec 16th)
* Maintain good documentation of their work as you progress. On your
website or on the MITERS website is fine. (this is good for your
future/present portfolio too)

Judging: Names will be stripped from proposals, then I'll email
everyone on the miters-keyholders list (about 20 people) for voting
and discussion (coolness / technicality will come into play here).
Final decisions will be made at general meeting Friday Oct. 14th
(affirmative action in encouraging new makers / underclassmen will
come into play here*), and winners notified by that Saturday (Oct
15th).

*Yes, I am explicitly stating that you should not be intimidated by x
crazy project you see on the MITERS site. All you really need is
enthusiasm for making things -- the rest will come naturally as you
ask people at MIT / MITERS for help with your crazy idea. :)

===FAQ===
Why: We are funding this to convince more people to join MITERS and/or
build things.

Money distribution: You would come to Friday build parties (every
Friday @ 7pm @ MITERS) and pull up website(s) for us to order your
parts from. This way we cut through the reimbursement craziness and
don't even step near cash-grant sinkholes. If you absolutely want your
part but can't make it, I'll create a spreadsheet doc that our
treasurer, tylerc, can check.

Build parties: Basically, a bunch of people who like making things
comes to hang out at MITERS. No dancing involved [yet].

Majors: We don't care what major you are. And we're definitely not
pure 6-1. We're self-funded, so not directly tied to any department.

save it elsewhere before you submit.
