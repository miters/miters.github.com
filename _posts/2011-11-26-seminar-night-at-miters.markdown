nancy edits on 2 dec 2011:

for reference, I talked (actually mostly I evangelized open source hardware and mentioned rise of EE but not really meche-oriented version control, then most people already knew how to use git & github) about:



	
  * upverter, solderpad, circuitbee, openhardwarehub (http://orangenarwhals.blogspot.com/2011/11/hardware-sharing-versioning-recent.html)

	
  * github.com, help.github.com, pro git [http://progit.org/book/](http://progit.org/book/), libraries.mit.edu/get/safari (then search for git, or embedded hardware, etc.)

	
  * [http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=1927](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=1927) (his made in china series is interesting too)

	
  * Here is the video which I decided not to hunt for during the talk: Open source hardware $1m and beyond - foo camp east 2010 by adafruit industries 2 years ago [http://vimeo.com/11407341](http://vimeo.com/11407341)
