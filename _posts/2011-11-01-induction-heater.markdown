Because documentation is good, I hear...so here's documentation of an old-ish (circa this June) project.

Inverter is a fullbridge of CM400 IGBT modules, matching transformer is something like 20:1. The whole thing resonates at ~65KHz. The driver is a simple fixed-frequency oscillator.

Sorry 'bout the lack of video...seems like I was too busy setting things on fire and forgot to video it =( Remember kiddies, setting a CDE940 film cap on fire=Terrible Idea!
